# Base `Class` for all private credentials.   A private credential is any credential that should not be publicly
# disclosed, such as a {Metasploit::Credential::Password password}, password hash, or key file.

  #

  # @!attribute cores
  #   The {Metasploit::Credential::Core core credentials} that combine this private credential with its
  #   {Metasploit::Credential::Public public credential} and/or {Metasploit::Credential::Realm realm}.

  # Attributes
  #

  # @!attribute created_at
  #   When this private credential was created.
  #
  #   @return [DateTime]

  # @!attribute data
  #   The private data for this credential.  The semantic meaning of this data varies based on subclass.
  #
  #   @return [String]

  # @!attribute id
  #   The id of this private credential in the database.  {#id} sequence is shared across all subclass {#type}s, so
  #   {#id} alone acts as a primary key without the need for a compound primary key (id, type).
  #
  #   @return [Integer] if saved to database.
  #   @return [nil] if not saved to database.

  # @!attribute type
  #   The name of the `Class`.  Used to instantiate the correct subclass when retrieving records from the database.
  #
  #   @return [String]

  # @!attribute updated_at
  #   The last time this private credential was updated.
  #
  #   @return [DateTime]
